# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains the Architecture Decision Records for the Shop Management System. ADRs document the important architectural decisions made throughout the project, including the context, options considered, and consequences of each decision.

## ADR Index

| ADR | Title | Status | Date | Impact |
|-----|-------|--------|------|--------|
| [ADR-001](./ADR-001-multi-tenant-architecture.md) | Multi-tenant Architecture | Accepted | 2024-01-01 | High |
| [ADR-002](./ADR-002-container-orchestration.md) | Container Orchestration Platform | Accepted | 2024-01-01 | High |
| [ADR-003](./ADR-003-database-technology.md) | Database Technology Selection | Accepted | 2024-01-01 | High |
| [ADR-004](./ADR-004-authentication-strategy.md) | Authentication & Authorization Strategy | Accepted | 2024-01-01 | High |

## Decision Categories

### Infrastructure Decisions (High Impact)
- **ADR-001**: Multi-tenant Architecture - Determines how we isolate tenant data
- **ADR-002**: Container Orchestration - Defines our compute platform strategy
- **ADR-003**: Database Technology - Sets our data persistence foundation

### Security Decisions (High Impact)  
- **ADR-004**: Authentication Strategy - Defines user security and access control

### Future ADR Topics
- Frontend Framework Selection
- Caching Strategy
- API Design Standards
- Monitoring & Observability
- CI/CD Pipeline Architecture
- Search Engine Technology
- Payment Processing Integration
- Notification System Design

## ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed**: Initial draft for review and discussion
2. **Accepted**: Decision has been approved and is being implemented
3. **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer recommended but may still be in use
4. **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

## Review Process

1. **Creation**: New ADRs created by architecture team or senior developers
2. **Review**: All ADRs reviewed by architecture team and relevant stakeholders
3. **Approval**: ADRs approved by technical leadership before acceptance
4. **Implementation**: Accepted ADRs guide implementation decisions
5. **Maintenance**: ADRs updated as implementations evolve or decisions change
