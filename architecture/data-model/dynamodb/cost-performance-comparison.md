## Detailed Performance Analysis

### Query Performance Comparison

#### 1. Product Detail Lookup (AP1)
**Use Case**: Most frequent - 200+ req/min

**PostgreSQL:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE tenant_id = ? AND id = ?;
-- Index: Primary key + tenant index
-- Performance: 2-5ms
-- Cost per query: ~$0.000001
```

**DynamoDB:**
```javascript
GetItem({ PK: 'TENANT#...', SK: 'PRODUCT#...' })
// Performance: 0.5-1ms
// Cost per query: 0.5 RCU = $0.000000125
```
**Winner: DynamoDB (3-5x faster, 8x cheaper)**

#### 2. Product Listing with Filters (AP2)
**Use Case**: Very frequent - 150+ req/min

**PostgreSQL:**
```sql
SELECT p.*, c.name as category_name
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.id
WHERE p.tenant_id = ? AND p.is_active = true 
  AND p.category_id = ? AND p.price BETWEEN ? AND ?
ORDER BY p.name LIMIT 50;
-- Index: Composite index needed
-- Performance: 8-25ms (depends on filters)
-- Cost per query: ~$0.000003
```

**DynamoDB:**
```javascript
Query({
  IndexName: 'GSI2-index',
  KeyConditionExpression: 'GSI2PK = :pk',
  FilterExpression: 'data.price BETWEEN :min AND :max',
  Limit: 50
})
// Performance: 3-6ms
// Cost per query: 2-4 RCU = $0.000001
```
**Winner: DynamoDB (2-3x faster, 3x cheaper)**

#### 3. Order Details with Items (AP4)
**Use Case**: Frequent - 120+ req/min

**PostgreSQL:**
```sql
SELECT o.*, oi.*, p.name as product_name
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
LEFT JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.id
WHERE o.tenant_id = ? AND o.id = ?;
-- Multiple joins required
-- Performance: 5-12ms
-- Cost per query: ~$0.000002
```

**DynamoDB:**
```javascript
Query({
  KeyConditionExpression: 'PK = :pk AND begins_with(SK, :sk)',
  // Returns order + all items in single query
})
// Performance: 2-4ms
// Cost per query: 1-2 RCU = $0.0000005
```
**Winner: DynamoDB (3x faster, 4x cheaper)**

#### 4. Complex Analytics Query (AP11)
**Use Case**: Sales by date with aggregation

**PostgreSQL:**
```sql
SELECT DATE(created_at) as sale_date,
       COUNT(*) as order_count,
       SUM(total_amount) as total_revenue,
       AVG(total_amount) as avg_order_value
FROM orders 
WHERE tenant_id = ? 
  AND status IN ('delivered', 'completed')
  AND created_at BETWEEN ? AND ?
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY sale_date DESC;
-- Native aggregation
-- Performance: 50-200ms (depends on date range)
-- Cost per query: ~$0.000005
```

**DynamoDB:**
```javascript
// Multiple queries + application aggregation required
Query({ /* Get orders by date range */ })
// Then aggregate in application
// Performance: 20-50ms (multiple queries)
// Cost per query: 10-20 RCU = $0.000005
```
**Winner: PostgreSQL (better for complex analytics)**

```

#### Storage:
```
Aurora Storage:
- 500GB × $0.10/GB = $50.00
- I/O requests: 50M/month × $0.20/1M = $10.00
```

#### Data Transfer:
```
- Intra-AZ: Free
- Inter-AZ: 100GB × $0.01/GB = $1.00
```

**PostgreSQL Total: $447.10/month**

### DynamoDB Single Table Costs (Monthly)

#### Provisioned Capacity (Recommended):
```
Read Capacity:
- Average: 300 RCU × $0.00013/hour × 720 = $28.08
- Peak scaling: Auto-scaling handles spikes

Write Capacity:
- Average: 100 WCU × $0.00065/hour × 720 = $46.80
- Peak scaling: Auto-scaling included
```

#### Storage:
```
- 500GB × $0.25/GB = $125.00
- Compressed data ~30% savings = $87.50
```

#### Global Secondary Indexes:
```
- 4 GSIs × 25% storage overhead = 125GB × $0.25 = $31.25
- GSI RCU/WCU included in main table provisioning
```

**DynamoDB Total: $149.63/month (67% savings!)**

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Entities (Week 1-2)
1. **Tenants, Users, Shops** → Direct migration
2. **Simple lookups** work immediately
3. **Authentication flows** fully functional

### Phase 2: Product Catalog (Week 3-4)
1. **Products, Categories** → Single table design
2. **Product search** → Basic implementation
3. **Inventory management** → Functional

### Phase 3: Order Management (Week 5-6)
1. **Orders, Order Items** → Hierarchical structure
2. **Payment processing** → Integrated
3. **Order tracking** → Real-time updates

### Phase 4: Analytics & Optimization (Week 7-8)
1. **Reporting queries** → Application-level aggregation
2. **Dashboard optimization** → Caching layer
3. **Search enhancement** → OpenSearch integration

## Risk Assessment

### PostgreSQL Risks:
- **Scaling costs**: Linear increase with growth
- **Performance degradation**: Requires ongoing optimization
- **Operational complexity**: Database administration required
- **Vendor lock-in**: Moderate (standard SQL portability)

### DynamoDB Risks:
- **Learning curve**: Team needs NoSQL expertise
- **Query limitations**: Some analytics queries complex
- **Vendor lock-in**: High (AWS-specific)
- **Design mistakes**: Expensive to fix wrong access patterns

## Recommendation Matrix

### Choose PostgreSQL if:
- ✅ Team has limited NoSQL experience
- ✅ Complex analytics queries are critical
- ✅ Query flexibility is more important than cost
- ✅ Rapid prototyping and iteration needed
- ✅ Multi-vendor cloud strategy

### Choose DynamoDB if:
- ✅ Cost optimization is priority (67% savings)
- ✅ Performance is critical (3x faster)
- ✅ Minimal operational overhead desired
- ✅ Predictable access patterns
- ✅ AWS-native architecture preferred

## Final Recommendation

**For your shop management system, I recommend:**

### Start with PostgreSQL (Months 1-12):
- Faster initial development
- Lower risk and complexity
- Easier team onboarding
- Full query flexibility

### Migrate to DynamoDB (Year 2+):
- When you reach 50K+ tenants
- When cost optimization becomes critical
- When team has gained NoSQL expertise
- When access patterns are stable

This hybrid approach gives you:
1. **Fast time-to-market** with PostgreSQL
2. **Future cost optimization** with DynamoDB migration path
3. **Risk mitigation** through proven SQL development
4. **Long-term scalability** with NoSQL benefits

The single table design I've created provides a clear migration path when you're ready to optimize for scale and cost.
