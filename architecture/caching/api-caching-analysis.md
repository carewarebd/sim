# API Caching Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes which API responses in the Shop Management System can be cached, their access frequency patterns, and appropriate caching strategies for each endpoint.

## Caching Categories

### 1. HIGH PRIORITY - Frequently Accessed, Rarely Changed

#### Product Catalog Data
**Endpoints:**
- `GET /products` - Product listings with pagination
- `GET /products/{productId}` - Individual product details
- `GET /marketplace/products/search` - Product search results
- `GET /marketplace/shops/nearby` - Nearby shops (location-based)

**Access Patterns:**
- **Frequency:** Very High (1000+ requests/minute during peak)
- **Change Rate:** Low-Medium (products updated few times per day)
- **Cache Duration:** 5-15 minutes
- **Cache Strategy:** Application-level + CDN edge caching

**Justification:**
- Product catalogs are browsed continuously by customers
- Product details change infrequently (price updates, stock changes are separate)
- Search results can be cached with smart invalidation
- Location-based queries can be cached with geographic boundaries

#### User Profile & Authentication Data
**Endpoints:**
- `GET /auth/user-profile` - User profile information
- `GET /tenants/{tenantId}/users` - Team member listings
- `GET /auth/permissions` - User permissions and roles

**Access Patterns:**
- **Frequency:** High (500+ requests/minute)
- **Change Rate:** Very Low (profile changes are infrequent)
- **Cache Duration:** 30-60 minutes
- **Cache Strategy:** Application-level caching with user-specific keys

#### Category & Configuration Data
**Endpoints:**
- Product categories and hierarchies
- System configuration settings
- Currency and localization data
- Tax configuration per region

**Access Patterns:**
- **Frequency:** Medium-High (loaded with every page/component)
- **Change Rate:** Very Low (admin changes occasionally)
- **Cache Duration:** 2-24 hours
- **Cache Strategy:** Application + CDN caching

### 2. MEDIUM PRIORITY - Moderately Accessed, Computation Intensive

#### Reports & Analytics (Aggregated)
**Endpoints:**
- `GET /reports/daily-sales` - Daily sales reports
- `GET /reports/sales-by-salesperson` - Salesperson performance
- `GET /reports/product-popularity` - Product popularity metrics

**Access Patterns:**
- **Frequency:** Medium (100-300 requests/hour)
- **Change Rate:** Time-dependent (daily/hourly updates acceptable)
- **Cache Duration:** 15 minutes - 1 hour (depending on report type)
- **Cache Strategy:** Application-level with time-based invalidation

**Special Considerations:**
- Historical reports (older than current day) can be cached longer (24+ hours)
- Real-time reports need shorter cache duration
- Can use background jobs to pre-compute and cache popular reports

#### Search Results & Filters
**Endpoints:**
- Product search with complex filters
- Faceted search results
- Auto-complete suggestions

**Access Patterns:**
- **Frequency:** High during business hours
- **Change Rate:** Medium (new products, price changes)
- **Cache Duration:** 10-30 minutes
- **Cache Strategy:** Multi-layer caching with search-specific optimization

### 3. LOW PRIORITY - Less Frequent Access, Acceptable Latency

#### Invoice & Document Generation
**Endpoints:**
- `GET /invoices` - Invoice listings
- `GET /invoices/{invoiceId}` - Invoice details
- `POST /invoices/{invoiceId}/generate-pdf` - PDF generation

**Access Patterns:**
- **Frequency:** Low-Medium (business-hours dependent)
- **Change Rate:** Low (invoices rarely change after creation)
- **Cache Duration:** 1-24 hours for listings, permanent for generated PDFs
- **Cache Strategy:** Application caching + S3/CDN for generated files

#### Marketplace Order History
**Endpoints:**
- Historical order data
- Customer order summaries
- Order tracking information (non-active orders)

**Access Patterns:**
- **Frequency:** Low (customers check occasionally)
- **Change Rate:** Very Low (historical data is immutable)
- **Cache Duration:** 1-6 hours
- **Cache Strategy:** Application-level caching

## NON-CACHEABLE DATA - Real-Time Critical

### 1. Live Inventory & Stock Levels
**Why Not Cacheable:**
- Stock levels change with every sale/purchase
- Critical for preventing overselling
- Must be real-time for accurate availability

**Alternative Approach:**
- Use WebSocket connections for live updates
- Cache product base info separately from stock levels
- Implement optimistic UI updates with rollback on conflicts

### 2. Order Processing & Payment Status
**Why Not Cacheable:**
- Order status changes rapidly during fulfillment
- Payment processing requires real-time verification
- Critical for customer experience and business operations

**Alternative Approach:**
- Real-time event streams for order updates
- Separate caching of order metadata vs status
- Push notifications for status changes

### 3. Real-Time Dashboard Analytics
**Why Minimal Caching:**
- Business owners need current sales data
- Stock alerts and notifications must be immediate
- Performance metrics affect real-time decisions

**Balanced Approach:**
- Very short cache duration (30 seconds - 2 minutes)
- Use WebSocket for critical metrics updates
- Cache historical comparisons and trends

### 4. Authentication Tokens & Sessions
**Why Not Cacheable:**
- Security-sensitive data
- Token expiration must be respected
- Session state changes with user actions

**Security Considerations:**
- Store in secure, encrypted client-side storage
- Implement proper token refresh mechanisms
- Clear caches on authentication changes

## Access Frequency Analysis

### Peak Traffic Patterns
```
High Traffic Endpoints (requests/minute):
- GET /products: 800-1200 rpm
- GET /marketplace/products/search: 600-900 rpm
- GET /products/{id}: 400-600 rpm
- GET /auth/user-profile: 300-500 rpm

Medium Traffic Endpoints (requests/minute):
- GET /reports/*: 50-150 rpm
- GET /orders: 100-200 rpm
- GET /invoices: 30-80 rpm

Low Traffic Endpoints (requests/minute):
- POST /products: 10-30 rpm
- PUT /products/{id}: 5-20 rpm
- Administrative endpoints: 1-10 rpm
```

### Cache Hit Ratio Expectations
- **Product Catalog:** 85-95% cache hit ratio
- **User Profiles:** 90-98% cache hit ratio
- **Search Results:** 70-85% cache hit ratio
- **Reports:** 60-80% cache hit ratio

## Recommendations

### Immediate Implementation Priority
1. **Product catalog caching** - Highest impact on performance
2. **User profile caching** - Reduces authentication overhead
3. **Category/config caching** - Improves page load times
4. **CDN implementation** - Geographic performance improvement

### Phase 2 Implementation
1. **Smart search result caching**
2. **Report pre-computation and caching**
3. **Advanced cache invalidation strategies**

### Monitoring Requirements
- Cache hit/miss ratios per endpoint
- Response time improvements
- Cache invalidation frequency and effectiveness
- Memory usage and cost impact
