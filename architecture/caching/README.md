This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the caching strategy of the Shop Management System.

## Files Overview

- **[api-caching-analysis.md](./api-caching-analysis.md)** - Analysis of which API endpoints can be cached and their access patterns
- **[cache-invalidation-strategy.md](./cache-invalidation-strategy.md)** - Strategies for handling real-time updates and cache consistency
- **[cache-layers-architecture.md](./cache-layers-architecture.md)** - Multi-layer caching architecture design
- **[real-time-updates-handling.md](./real-time-updates-handling.md)** - Solutions for real-time dashboard updates vs caching
- **[implementation-guide.md](./implementation-guide.md)** - Practical implementation guidelines and best practices
- **[performance-metrics.md](./performance-metrics.md)** - Expected performance improvements and monitoring

## Key Challenges Addressed

1. **Frequently Accessed Data** - Identifying and caching high-traffic API responses
2. **Real-time Updates** - Balancing caching with real-time dashboard requirements
3. **Data Consistency** - Ensuring cache invalidation doesn't break real-time features
4. **Multi-tenant Considerations** - Tenant-isolated caching strategies

## Quick Reference

### High-Priority Cacheable Data
- Product catalogs and details
- User profiles and permissions
- Category hierarchies
- Static configuration data
- Report aggregations (with time-based invalidation)

### Real-time Critical Data (Minimal/No Caching)
- Live inventory levels
- Order status updates
- Payment processing
- Real-time analytics dashboard metrics
